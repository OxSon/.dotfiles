# .dotfiles
Various dotfiles and configs. Not guaranteed to be 100% working, optimal, or desireable. Please understand I am a chronic config tweaker and am not always as neat as I should be. That being said-- enjoy.

# Set-up
### 1. Clone the repo to your preferred location and enter the root directory

`git clone https://github.com/OxSon/.dotfiles`

`cd .dotfiles`

### 2. Init & update submodules

`git submodule init && git submodule update`

### 3. Install 

`./install`

Note: at this point you may want to edit the config file at `.dotfiles/default.conf.yaml`. Please refer to the excellent project documentation available at [the dotbot project page](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)
